I love Kebab and Pizzas, not only because I am Mediterranean myself!
I love it because of its great taste despite its simplicity!

For me a Kebab is an open pizza, or a portable pizza, and pizza is an open kebab when yo have time to put your foot up.

Both have the 3 macronutrient groups...Protein, vegetables and Carbs and you can portion them when you prepare it ðŸ˜‹
