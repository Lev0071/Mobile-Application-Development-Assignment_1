            I love Kebab and Pizzas, not only because I am Mediterranean myself!
            I love it because of its great taste despite its simplicity!
            
            For me a Kebab is an open pizza, or a portable pizza, and pizza is an open kebab when yo have time to put your foot up.
            
            Both have the 3 macronutrient groups...Protein, vegetables and Carbs and you can portion them when you prepare it ðŸ˜‹
